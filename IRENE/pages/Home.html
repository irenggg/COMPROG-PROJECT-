	Our families are where we experience our biggest triumphs and our deepest vulnerabilities
	and they are where we have the greatest potential to do good. We believe the family is divine 
	in nature and that God designates it as the fundamental building block of society, both on earth 
	and through eternity. As such, it becomes the foundation for civilization and a sanctuary for the 
	individual. It is where we learn the social graces of loyalty, cooperation, and trust. It is where 
	we learn to love ourselves and each other, to bear one another’s burdens, to find meaning in our 
	life and to give purpose to others’ lives, and to feel the value of being part of something greater 
	than ourselves.

	There is a universal desire for oneness among people—we want to belong. It’s why we collaborate, 
	support common causes, cheer for sports teams, feel nationalism; it’s why we build villages, towns, 
	and cities. For the fortunate among us, that desire began with loving parents and siblings in a home 
	that was equal parts refuge and laboratory for experimenting with our potential, our beliefs, and our 
	identity. Those who had less than this ideal situation growing up still have the capacity to forge families 
	of their own making. We can create places where children feel loved and supported, where they’re taught that 
	this life reflects what we previously had in heaven, and that our families will be ours through eternity if 
	we accept Jesus Christ’s Atonement and follow His commandments.
