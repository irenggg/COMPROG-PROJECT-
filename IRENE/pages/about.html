	Part of belonging to a family means we each step up to help each other. While our first role in a 
	family is as a dependent child, the part we play is never small—and it continues to grow in scope 
	and importance as we mature.

	It is our duty, even a sacred responsibility, to care for those in our family. In “The Family: A Proclamation 
	to the World,” God expressed that parents are “to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide 
	for their physical and spiritual needs.” We are also told that parents “will be held accountable before God 
	for the discharge of these obligations”.
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-size:25px; color:black; background-color:BlanchedAlmond;">
	Whether parent or child, sibling or spouse, every one of God’s children has a role in taking care of one another. 
	And like the pattern set by our heavenly family, we must provide and care for each other with love. We can follow 
	Heavenly Father’s example by encouraging our loved ones in their trials, listening to their worries, cheering for 
	them in their efforts and successes, and comforting them in their sorrows.
	</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-size:25px; color:black; background-color:BlanchedAlmond;">
	By upholding God’s principles in our homes, we can influence those around us. Many people take pride in their family 
	names and the heritage of honorable people they represent. Others are setting aside past mistakes and seeking to fulfill 
	the divine roles of family anew. No matter our past, all of us can have essential roles in nurturing and strengthening 
	our family ties on earth into relationships that can link generations in love throughout the eternities.
